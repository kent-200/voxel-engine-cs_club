### Instructions

Make sure to clone this repository recursively!

```
git clone https://github.com/compsci-adl/voxel-engine --recursive
```

If you have cloned it non-recursively:

```

## Troubleshooting

#### Missing libraries error and ```libs/``` content missing:

Either increase Git's maximum download size, then try again.

```
git config --global http.postBuffer 104857600
git submodule update --init
```

Or manually clone libraries into their corresponding ``libs/`` folder.


#### Missing libraries Ubuntu

In Ubuntu, install all the required packages with:

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
